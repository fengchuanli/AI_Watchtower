# AI Watchtower Optimization Log

Use this file to record every automated or manual optimization. New entries go at the top.

## 2026-06-20 15:04 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 4 Day 25 CSS maintainability by removing obsolete selectors left behind by earlier expanded homepage cards, old all-news batch panels, and unused detail/fallback styles. Added the missing `--soft` design token used by the history controls and extended site validation to catch undefined CSS custom properties and retired selectors before they reappear.
- Changed files:
  - `styles.css`
  - `scripts/validate-site.mjs`
  - `docs/optimization-log.md`
- Verification:
  - Attempted `git pull --ff-only origin main`, but GitHub DNS resolution failed in this environment.
  - Read `docs/product-principles.md` and kept the change focused on lower-maintenance static Pages styling without changing the reader-facing information flow.
  - Ran syntax checks for `app.js`, `all-news.js`, `news-detail.js`, `tags.js`, `scripts/validate-site.mjs`, `scripts/validate-data.mjs`, and `scripts/validate-pages.mjs`.
  - Ran `node scripts/validate-data.mjs` and validated 3 current news items against 22 sources.
  - Ran `node scripts/validate-site.mjs` and validated homepage metadata, 36 local references, static page link targets, undefined CSS custom properties, and retired CSS selectors.
  - Ran `node scripts/validate-pages.mjs` and validated the GitHub Pages 404 fallback.
  - Parsed `index.html`, `news-detail.html`, `all-news.html`, `tags.html`, `archive.html`, and `404.html` with Python's HTML parser.
  - Validated `data/news.json`, `data/news-history.json`, and `data/sources.json` with JSON parsing.
  - Ran a lightweight class-selector scan and found no obvious unused class selectors.
  - Ran `git diff --check`.
- Commit: Local implementation commit `4d86bf4` (`清理未使用样式选择器`). Log follow-up commit will be created after this entry. Push is pending because this environment could not resolve `github.com`.

## 2026-06-20 14:03 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 4 Day 24 sharing metadata for the all-news page.

  - Ran `git diff --check`.
- Commit: Local implementation commit `2c682d1` (`完善全部情报分享元数据`). Push is pending because this environment could not resolve `github.com`.

## 2026-06-20 14:02 JST

- Focus: Flattened the all-news page into a compact time-ordered title list without large batch panels, changed the homepage feed so it no longer duplicates the TOP3 items and only shows concise non-TOP3 signals, and expanded the source policy to include AI leader, capital, acquisition, IPO/listing, compute, and strategic company events when they materially affect the AI landscape.
- Changed files:
  - `all-news.html`
  - `all-news.js`
  - `app.js`
  - `index.html`

  - Ran `git diff --check`.
- Commit: Local implementation commit; push is pending because this environment could not resolve `github.com`.

## 2026-06-20 13:40 JST

- Focus: Moved the `查看全部情报` entry directly after `今日 TOP3` so readers can continue from today's priority items into the full archive without scrolling to the bottom, and changed the all-news page from long explanation cards into compact title-only rows that link to the in-site detail pages.
- Changed files:
  - `index.html`
  - `all-news.js`
  - `styles.css`
  - `scripts/validate-site.mjs`
  - `docs/optimization-log.md`
- Verification:

- Changed files:
  - `data/news.json`
  - `data/news-history.json`
  - `docs/optimization-log.md`
- Verification:
  - Attempted `git pull --ff-only origin main`, but GitHub DNS resolution failed in this environment.
  - Read `data/sources.json` and `docs/source-policy.md`; used official/RSS-oriented source policy and avoided random scraping, rumors, search-result snippets, and community discussion.
  - Checked OpenAI News, OpenAI Developers RSS, Anthropic Newsroom, Google DeepMind News, Mistral News, NVIDIA AI Blog, Microsoft AI/ Security pages, and historical source URLs to avoid repeated coverage.
  - Ran `node scripts/validate-data.mjs` after the data rewrite and fixed the only structural issue before continuing.

## 2026-06-19 21:04 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 4 Day 22 homepage card visual rhythm and mobile spacing. News cards now render their title, summary, trend, ranking reason, and selection score inside a dedicated card body with explicit grid gaps, while the footer is separated by a quiet rule. Mobile cards use slightly tighter padding and spacing so the current TOP3 feed remains easier to scan without removing editorial context or source-boundary cues.
- Changed files:
  - `app.js`
  - `styles.css`
  - `scripts/validate-site.mjs`
  - `docs/optimization-log.md`
- Verification:
  - Attempted `git pull --ff-only origin main`, but GitHub DNS resolution failed in this environment.
  - Read `docs/product-principles.md` and kept the change focused on reducing homepage reading burden for Chinese readers.
  - Ran syntax checks for `app.js`, `all-news.js`, `news-detail.js`, `tags.js`, `scripts/validate-data.mjs`, `scripts/validate-site.mjs`, and `scripts/validate-pages.mjs`.
  - Ran `node scripts/validate-data.mjs` and validated 3 current news items against 18 sources.

  - Ran `git diff --check`.
  - Attempted a local browser render check, but the sandbox denied local port binding and the in-app browser security policy blocked `file://` navigation.
- Commit: Local implementation commit will be created after this log update; final hash is recorded in the automation memory and run summary because this log entry is part of the commit. Push is pending until GitHub DNS/network access is available.

## 2026-06-19 20:03 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 3 Day 21 Chinese copy clarity and consistency for the homepage deep briefing. Localized reader-facing structural labels such as the deep briefing kicker, section labels, `So What?`, `FinOps`, and `checklist` wording into Chinese-first copy while preserving product names, model names, API names, source facts, and verification boundaries. Added validation to prevent common unexplained English structural phrases from returning to visible editorial copy.
- Changed files:
  - `data/news.json`
  - `app.js`
  - `scripts/validate-data.mjs`
  - `scripts/validate-site.mjs`
  - `docs/news-data-format.md`

## 2026-06-19 19:03 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 3 Day 20 product maintainability by adding stale-item and repeated historical coverage guards. The data validator now rejects current feed items whose `publishedAt` is more than seven days behind the edition date, blocks current source URLs already captured in older archive batches, and flags current titles that resemble older archive coverage unless a fresh source fact makes the update distinct.
- Changed files:
  - `scripts/validate-data.mjs`
  - `scripts/validate-site.mjs`
  - `docs/news-data-format.md`
  - `docs/optimization-log.md`

## 2026-06-19 18:02 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 3 Day 19 source policy for VisionHub-style narrative events without weakening fact safety. The source policy now explains how to handle vendor-written customer stories, policy proposals, benchmarks, and company narratives: use `厂商主张` when appropriate, verify only the narrow fact that the vendor made the claim, and require missing external proof before upgrading outcomes. The data validator now enforces this boundary for `厂商主张` items across the current feed and history.
- Changed files:
  - `docs/source-policy.md`
  - `docs/news-data-format.md`
  - `scripts/validate-data.mjs`
  - `docs/optimization-log.md`
- Verification:
  - Attempted `git pull --ff-only origin main`, but GitHub DNS resolution failed in this environment.

  - Ran `git diff --check`.
- Commit: Local implementation commit `78a5fb8` (`强化厂商叙事来源边界`). Push is pending until GitHub DNS/network access is available.

## 2026-06-19 17:33 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 3 Day 18 product maintainability by strengthening de-duplication before publication. The data validator now normalizes Chinese/Latin titles, compares title-token overlap, and rejects near-duplicate current or historical headlines in addition to the existing repeated source URL checks, so the archive is less likely to republish the same event with slightly different wording.
- Changed files:
  - `scripts/validate-data.mjs`
  - `scripts/validate-site.mjs`
  - `docs/news-data-format.md`
  - `docs/optimization-log.md`
- Verification:
  - Attempted `git pull --ff-only origin main`, but GitHub DNS resolution failed in this environment.

  - Ran `node scripts/validate-site.mjs` and validated homepage metadata, 36 local references, static page link targets, and the de-duplication validation guard.
  - Ran `node scripts/validate-pages.mjs` and validated the GitHub Pages 404 fallback.
  - Parsed `index.html`, `news-detail.html`, `all-news.html`, `tags.html`, `archive.html`, and `404.html` with Python's HTML parser.
  - Validated `data/news.json`, `data/news-history.json`, `data/sources.json`, and `package-lock.json` when present with `python3 -m json.tool`.
  - Ran `git diff --check`.
- Commit: Local implementation commit `c82c8ca`; log follow-up commit recorded separately because adding this hash changes repository history. Push is pending until GitHub DNS/network access is available.

## 2026-06-19 17:00 JST

- Focus: Published the 17:00 JST AI news intelligence update with official OpenAI signals on ChatGPT health intelligence, rare-disease genomic reanalysis, and ChatGPT Enterprise usage analytics/spend controls. Kept source boundaries explicit: health and enterprise metrics are OpenAI vendor disclosures, while the rare-disease item still needs continued NEJM AI and external clinical validation.
- Changed files:
  - `data/news.json`
  - `data/news-history.json`
  - `docs/optimization-log.md`
- Verification:
  - Attempted `git pull --ff-only origin main`, but GitHub DNS resolution failed in this environment.

  - Ran `git diff --check`.
- Commit: Local implementation commit will be created after this log update; final hash is recorded in the automation memory and run summary. Push is pending until GitHub DNS/network access is available.

## 2026-06-19 16:03 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 3 Day 17 source-boundary wording on news detail pages. Each detail briefing now shows a dedicated source-boundary panel that separates what the linked source directly supports, AI Watchtower's editorial interpretation, and what the item still cannot prove, using existing `provenance`, `detailTrend`, and `claimBoundary` fields rather than adding unverified claims.
- Changed files:
  - `news-detail.js`
  - `styles.css`
  - `scripts/validate-site.mjs`
  - `docs/news-data-format.md`
  - `docs/optimization-log.md`

  - Ran `git diff --check`.
- Commit: Local implementation commit will be created after this log update; final hash is recorded in the automation memory and run summary because this log entry is part of the commit. Push is pending until GitHub DNS/network access is available.

## 2026-06-19 15:04 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 3 Day 16 product quality by adding validation that every promoted item can support an in-site incident briefing. The data validator now checks current TOP3 items and the latest archive snapshot for event explanation, trend meaning, ranking value, reader impact, reader use, next checks, evidence threshold, claim boundary, downgrade signal, source role, provenance, verification status, follow-up questions, and sufficient narrative/evidence scores before promotion; the detail page also rejects items that cannot fill the incident briefing sections before rendering.
- Changed files:
  - `scripts/validate-data.mjs`
  - `news-detail.js`
  - `scripts/validate-site.mjs`
  - `docs/news-data-format.md`

## 2026-06-19 14:04 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 3 Day 15 editorial quality by adding structured selection scoring for the current TOP3 items. Each current item now records impact, novelty, narrative strength, evidence quality, reader utility, total score, and a short Chinese scoring note; the homepage renders the score beside the ranking reason, and validation checks score shape and totals for the current feed and latest archive snapshot.
- Changed files:
  - `data/news.json`
  - `data/news-history.json`
  - `app.js`
  - `styles.css`

  - Ran `git diff --check`.
- Commit: Pending local commit `更新08点AI新闻情报`; push may be blocked if GitHub DNS remains unavailable.

## 2026-06-18 21:02 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 1 Day 4 detail-page visual hierarchy by adding a clear reading-path band before the briefing sections. The detail page now explicitly guides readers from `速览` to `全貌图`, `事件解读`, `核对边界`, and `来源`, with responsive styling and source-panel emphasis so the original source remains a verification step rather than the primary reading path.
- Changed files:
  - `news-detail.js`
  - `styles.css`

## 2026-06-18 20:02 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 2 Day 13 topic empty states by making planned but uncovered homepage topics visible instead of silently omitting them. The current edition now shows covered topic groups normally and also labels Agent, policy, infrastructure, or other absent planned themes as `本期未捕捉` with Chinese editorial reasons, so readers understand that no eligible signal was selected rather than assuming the site forgot the topic.

## 2026-06-18 17:09 JST

- Focus: Published the 17:00 JST AI news intelligence update. Official source indexes did not show a newer post after the 08:00 run, so this batch uses non-repeated Google/DeepMind official signals that still support full in-site briefings: DiffusionGemma's diffusion-text low-latency model route, the Sierra Leone Guided Learning RCT, and Gemini 3.5 Live Translate.

## 2026-06-18 16:03 JST

- Focus: Improved Phase 2 Day 9 source-family grouping by adding edition-level source-family framing to the homepage feed metadata.
